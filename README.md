A random forest and a gradient boosting machine learning models were built to predict whether weightlifters are performing barbell lifts correctly. The models were trained on data gathered from six individuals wearing body accelerometers and doing barbell lifts in five different ways, one correctly and four incorrectly. The final model is tested against a validation dataset consisting of twenty test cases. The goal is to predict in which of the five different ways the lift can be performed each test falls in.
